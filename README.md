### 1. What the Project Does

This project develops a hybrid Transformer model that integrates HuBERT, LSTM, and ResNet-50, leveraging the strengths of self-supervised learning, sequence modeling, and convolutional feature extraction. It addresses the limitations of traditional speech emotion recognition methods in capturing long-range dependencies, processing limited data, and extracting effective features, thereby improving the accuracy of emotion recognition. The modular design of the model and the incorporation of the Transformer architecture not only enhance the flexibility and scalability of the model but also enable efficient fusion and classification of multimodal features.

### 2. Why the Project is Useful

The hybrid Transformer model proposed in this project holds significant value in the field of speech emotion recognition. By combining the strengths of HuBERT, LSTM, and ResNet-50, it effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional methods in capturing long-range dependencies and handling limited data, significantly improving the accuracy of emotion recognition. In intelligent customer service, it can identify customer emotions in real time, helping to adjust communication strategies. In mental health monitoring, it can assist professionals in diagnosing conditions through voice analysis. In education, teachers can use it to understand students' emotions and optimize teaching methods. Additionally, the model utilizes ResNet-50's convolutional layers to analyze audio data in detail, capturing spatial hierarchical features and providing richer insights for emotion recognition. This approach offers new directions and ideas for future research and applications, demonstrating significant technical importance and broad application prospects.

### 3. How Users Can Use the Project

Users can quickly utilize this project by following these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   After cloning the project repository, pull the base Docker image `pytorch/pytorch:1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel`, and install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   git clone <GitHub repository link>
   cd <project folder>
   ```

2. **Prepare Data**  
   Download and preprocess the nEMO dataset (or other speech emotion datasets) to ensure the data format meets the project requirements. The data processing scripts are included in the project, and the dataset can be obtained from Huggingface:

   ```
   https://huggingface.co/datasets/amu-cai/nEMO
   ```

   Then, extract intermediate features using:

   ```bash
   python feature_extract.py
   ```

   This will generate `arrays.pkl` containing the intermediate feature values.

3. **Train and Test the Model**  
   Train the model using the default configuration:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   To customize training parameters, modify the configuration file as needed.
